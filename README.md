## Thor
**Thor** is the working title for a web-based weather app relying on data combined from vedur.is and yr.no. The basic idea is to fetch the data from XML files which are already provided free of charge, and parse it to JSON objects for further use in the app.

Beside it's core function as a weather app, **Thor** will have some "fun" features which will be described in more detail as development progresses.
